PROJECT TITLE: IP (Individual Project) for SDA6.

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a general To Do list that is sorted either by date or by its category. There is no limitation to the category you can enter and you must be careful of spelling since the program cannot differentiate between the text. I would recommend showing the list before you make a selection so you don't make any mistakes. The functions are as follows: 

1. Show a task list, sort a task by category or by date. 
2. Add a new task by inputing a new task title followed by the category. 
3. Edit task, Choose a task to edit, once task has been chosen you can choose to change the title, change the category, Mark the task as done, mark the task as Undone, remove task. 
4. Save whatever operations you have done and quit the program.
